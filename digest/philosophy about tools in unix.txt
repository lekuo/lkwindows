There is a philosophy about tools in unix.

Code on remote server? Openssh, to go there, or SSHFS/NFS to bring it to me.

Need to edit some subset of a directory's files? ls |grep *.py

Need to be N places at once? screen/tmux

Looking for something? ctags

How about quickly change local context? ^Z -> fg

Of course you'll need something to deliver these commands: zsh/bash/ksh

Since everything is a file, and text is the lingua franca of unix,

You'll need something to deal with that. Small, fast and focused.

Vim.

Certainly Emacs is more extensible than Vim. But, when you use Vim, your IDE is unix.

Emacs is certainly a great little IDE, but it's a bit small and restrictive for me.
