Try to look ahead at least 12 seconds

Always signal at least five seconds before
changing lanes


the right lane if you are traveling at a
slower speed than traffic, the left lane for
passing, and the center lane for cruising

Do not be distracted or slow down excessively
to look at incidents in or near the roadway.
